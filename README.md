# Text_Summarizer
This text summarizer chrome extension was created for the Capital One Challenge. It takes in the url of the current tab and returns a summary, url of the page, and 3 links for relevant articles. The API was obtained from the Mashape marketplace. If the user uses the extension for an article, closes the popup, and then clicks button to use the summarizer right after, the data is immediately restored. This feature saves time for summarizing an article that was just done. 

This extension has been tested on articles from many websites (CNN, ESPN, Washington Post etc). It works well generally on all articles. However, on some occasions, the data is not sent back to my extension, so the summary is not formed, for reasons unknown to me. To use the extension, I will send a .crx file to the user. Then, the user must unzip the files to a new folder. After going to the extensions dashboard and ensuring developer mode is on, they should 'load the unpacked extension'. The icon should appear in the upper right corner and be ready to use!
